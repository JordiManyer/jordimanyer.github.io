My name is Jordi. I'm currently a computational mathematics PhD student at Monash university. My research focusses on computational methods and solvers for advanced Finite Element Methods (FEM) in the context of High-Performance-Computing (HPC). 

### My story

I was born in Barcelona, second largest city in Spain and (in my humble opinion) one of best places to live on the planet, in 1996. 

From 2014 to 2019, I studied mathematics and physics engineering at Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya (UPC) as part of the CFIS program, an academic excellence program in which I had the chance to meet some of the most academically talented people I've ever had the pleasure to encounter. As part of by bachelor thesis, I had the chance to do a 10 month internship at GeorgiaTech, exploring numerical models for binary black-hole mergers. 

I then returned to Barcelona in 2019 to do my Masters degree in mathematics, which partially took place during the pandemic. During that time, I also started teaching numerical methods at UPC (as an adjoint professor) and found employment as a researcher in computational nuclear fusion at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC). BSC is one of the largest High Performance Computing (HPC) centers in Europe, and hosts the Marenostrum supercomputer. As part of the Nuclear Fusion team, I had the chance to participate into major European and global fusion research consortiums like ITER and EuroFusion. 

In 2022, I moved to Melbourne (Australia) to start my PhD at Monash University. My research focusses in developping fast, scalable and robust methods for solving sparse, distributed linear systems arising from Finite Element Method (FEM) problems. 

### My interests

Coding and Mathematics are my passions! I enjoy solving complex maths problems using the power of computers, and admire the beauty of a well-structured perfectly-optimized and math-proofed piece of code. My curiosity also frequently leads me to explore other aspects of programming such as AI and Machine-Learning, web and application developpement. 

I'm also a huge nature lover. Backpacking, hiking and camping are my go-to weekend plans. Travelling and discovering new places is also one of my main pleasures in life: One of my life goals would be to live in all five continents at least once, although I am quite sure I want to eventually settle down somewhere along my dear Mediterranean coast. 

On a day-to-day basis I enjoy sports, working out and having drinks with my loved ones. I've also practiced Judo for most of my life, although I currently do it exclusively as a hobby (my competing days are long gone)! I am also a great cook and foodie, always ready to taste and experience new cultures and cuisines.
